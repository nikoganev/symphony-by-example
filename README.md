## Symphony By Example
Contains documentation and examples based on use cases that apply to the API's, language bindings and SDKs being developed within the Symphony community. Documentation of design patterns and practical use cases are a key focus. In most cases, examples should be deep linked into project from external repositories. With this said, contributed code snippets and full examples are allowed.
